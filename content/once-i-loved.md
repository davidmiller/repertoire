{{ lyrics("Once I loved
And I gave so much love to this love
You were the world to me
Once I cried at the thought

I was foolish and proud
And let you say goodbye
Then one day from my infinite sadness

You came and brought me love again
Now I know, that no matter, whatever befalls
I'll never let you go

I will hold you close
Make you stay
Because love is the saddest thing
When it goes away
Love is the saddest thing
When it goes away") }}
