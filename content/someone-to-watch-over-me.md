{{ lyrics("There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still we're often told seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain girl I've had in mind

Looking everywhere, haven't found her yet
She's the big affair I cannot forget
Only girl I ever think of with regret

I'd like to add her initials to my monogram
Tell me where's the shepherd for this lost lamb

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that she turns out to be
Someone to watch over me") }}
