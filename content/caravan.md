{{ lyrics("Night and stars above that shine so bright
The myst'ry of their fading light
That shines upon our caravan

Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep
Across the sand so I may keep
This mem'ry of our caravan

This is so exciting, you are so inviting
Resting in my arms
As I thrill to the magic charms

Of you beside me here, beneath the blue
My dream of love is coming true
Within our desert caravan") }}
