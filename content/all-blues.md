{{ lyrics("The sea, the sky, the you and I
The sea, the sky, for you and I
I'll know we're all blues
All Shades, all hues, all blues

Some blues are sad
But some are glad,
Dark-sad or bright-gald
They're all blues
All shades, all hues, all blues

The color of colors
The blues are more than a color
They're a moan of pain
A Taste of strife
And a sad refrain") }}
