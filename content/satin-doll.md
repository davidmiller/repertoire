{{ lyrics("Cigarette holder- wich wigs me
Over her shoulder - she digs me
Out cattin' - that satin doll

Baby shall we go - out skippin'
Careful amigo - you're flippin'
Speaks latin - that satin doll

She's nobody's fool so I'm playing it cool as can be
I'll give it a whirl but I ain't for no girl catching me

Telephone numbers - well you know
Doing my rhumbas - with uno
And that'n my satin doll") }}
