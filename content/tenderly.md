{{ lyrics("The evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly
The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly
Then you and I came wandering by
And lost in a sigh were we
The shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly
I canâ€™t forget how two hearts met breathlessly

Your arms opened wide
And closed me inside
You took my lips
You took my love
So tenderly") }}
