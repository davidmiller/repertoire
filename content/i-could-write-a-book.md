{{ lyrics("If they ask me, I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper and look
I could write a preface on how we met
So the world would never forget

And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you, a lot
Then the world discovers as my book ends
How to make two lovers of friends

If they ask me, I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper and look
I could write a preface on how we met
So the world would never forget, never, never forget

And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you, allot
Then the world discovers as my book ends
How to make two lovers of friends") }}
