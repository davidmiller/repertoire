{{ lyrics("In a sentimental mood
I can see the stars come through my room
While your loving attitude
Is like a flame that lights the gloom

On the wings of every kiss
Drifts a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss
You make my paradise complete

Rose petals seem to fall
It's all I could dream to call you mine
My heart's a lighter thing
Since you made this night a thing divine

In a sentimental mood
I'm within a world so heavenly
For I never dreamt that you'd
Be loving sentimental me") }}
