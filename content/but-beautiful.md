{{ lyrics("Love is funny, or it's sad
Or it's quiet, or it's mad
It's a good thing or it's bad
But beautiful

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall you fall
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all

Love is tearful, or it's gay
It's a problem or it's play
It's a heartache either way
But beautiful

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go
And that would be but beautiful I know") }}
