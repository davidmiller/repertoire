{{ lyrics("Sing low, sing clear
Sweet words in my ear
Not a whisper of despair
But love's own prayer

Sing on, until
You bring back the thrill
Of a sentimental tune
That died too soon

Our harmony was lost
But you forgave, I forgot
Whisper not of quarrels past
You know we've had our last

So now, we'll be
On key constantly
Love will whisper on eternally") }}
