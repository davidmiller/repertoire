{{ lyrics("Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon
Under the sun

Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, darlin', where you are
I think of you night and day

Night and day, why's it so
That this longing for you
Follows wherever I go

In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you night and day

Night and day, under the hide of me
There's an, ooh, such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me

And this torment won't be through
Till you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day") }}
