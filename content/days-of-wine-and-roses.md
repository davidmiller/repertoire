{{ lyrics("The days of wine and roses
Laugh and run away
Like a child at play
Through the meadowland toward a closing door
A door marked never more
That wasn't there before

The lonely night discloses
Just a passing breeze
Filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you
Wine and roses and you

The days of wine and roses
Laugh and run away
Like a child at play
Through the meadowland toward a closing door
A door marked never more
That wasn't there before

The lonely night discloses
Just a passing breeze
Filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you") }}
