Title: About this site

This site was made in order to help exploring the standard repertoire.

The list of 'Top 201 Jazz Standards' it uses was compiled by consulting other
people's lists of "top n standards" on the internet for a baseline, and then
coming up with one that represented a consensus view.

I then adjusted it to make sure it had some missing tunes that regularly get called
at London jam sessions, and to make room for one or two personal favourites.
