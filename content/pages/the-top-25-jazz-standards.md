Mastering the jazz repertoire is a journey that takes a
lifetime of study, and at times on the way it seems
overwhelming. There are thousands of
songs to choose from and it can feel like the repertoire
is endless when you’re at a jam session where every song
that gets called is completely new to you.

The good news is, some jazz standards are very much more
important than others.

Some tunes get called often while others are obscure and
come up rarely. Believe it or not, the number of songs
that are called all the time is actually quite manageable
- start with these and you'll be well on your way to being
on familiar territory most of the time.

{{ h2("How do we know it’s these songs?") }}

Lots of people have made lists of these big songs - and
there's a broad consensus - but I wanted something a bit
more objective and data-driven. This is exactly the kind
of problem that’s well suited to a really good spreadsheet.

Since 2019 I've been keeping a record
of every song that gets called at every session I've played
at so I can take a look at the patterns that emerge.

This sample is of just over two thousand calls (occasions when a
song was played) at jam sessions, gigs and rehearsals in London
since mid 2019. This data reflects my experience - if you go to different sessions
then yours will contrast - but based on research and
conversations, the broad sweep seems relatively consistent.

So what do we learn from the data now it's been collected?

{{ h2("Most songs are called only very rarely") }}

In this dataset songs only called once are by far the
largest group. Many of these are relatively obscure tunes
brought by a horn player or singer to one jam session that
probably won't come up again very soon. This long tail behaviour is
what you'd expect given the thousands of jazz songs out
there and the social nature of jazz musicianship.

A couple thousand or so is still a relatively tiny sample. You would
expect some of these at least to get called more and climb
up the chart, while the overall shape of the distribution
remained similar.

{{ h2("A relatively small number of songs comprise the majority of calls") }}

If you only knew 10 songs, this would make up 19% of all
calls. If you knew 25 songs this
would get you to 36%.

![Chart of call count percentage]({static}/images/514-call-count-perc.png)

Getting to the point where you knew every other song requires
you to know 42 songs. Although this may seem like a lot when you're just
starting out, with time this will come to feel very manageable.

The songs here are driven by this data, although I've
editorialised slightly where rehearsals for bands I play in have made somewhat
obscure tunes rise up the list.<br /> (A link to the full data
is below if you're curious to draw your own conclusions.)

As I carry on collecting data, I’ll be adjusting these to
reflect any changes that come up.

{{ h2("The Top 201 Standards on this site are a good expanded list") }}

Songs from the list on this site comprise some 78% of calls. For
a list that's aiming to be representative of the most important
tunes in the repertoire rather than exhaustive, that feels pretty
decent.

{{ h2("What should I do if I already know these 25?") }}

By the time you know these tunes, it’s time to forge your own path
through the repertoire. While picking common songs is still helpful,
once you have that core set of tunes down, it can also be fun to
pick something a bit more obscure !

If you don’t already have a list of songs you like and want to learn,
I’d suggest listening to the
[master spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2jCq77SrgiVScSECYfbeDQ?si=efxyUA0tQl6zISYoBWF9fA) of 200+ songs on shuffle and waiting till something
really grabs your ear, then investigating that.


{{ h2("Notes") }}

The raw data underlying this post is
[available in a CSV here](https://github.com/davidmiller/repertoire/tree/master/content/data/513.calls.csv).

It takes in 2,038 calls of 308 songs from 160 sessions since 22 Jun 2019.

_Updated October 2021:_ This post was updated in October 2021 to reflect changes in the
data since the original publication. Autumn Leaves and Take The A Train left the top 10 (but not the top 25)
to be replaced with Caravan and There Will Never Be Another You. Bye Bye Blackbird, Doxy, Footprints, Song
For My Father and Summertime slipped out of the top 25, replaced by Four, Ornithology, On The Sunny Side Of
The Street, Solar and This I Dig Of You.
