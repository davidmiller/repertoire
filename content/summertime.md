{{ lyrics("Summertime, and the living is easy.
Fish are jumping, and the cotton is high.
Oh, your daddy's rich, and your ma is good-looking.
So, hush, little baby, don't you cry.

One of these mornings you're gonna rise up singing.
Yes, you'll spread your wings and you'll take to the sky.
But 'til that morning, there's nothing can harm you.
Yes, with daddy and mammy standing by.

Summertime, and the living is easy.
Fish are jumping, and the cotton is high.
Oh, your daddy's rich, and your ma is good-looking.
So, hush, little baby. Baby, don't you cry.") }}
