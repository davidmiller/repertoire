{{ lyrics("Pack up all my care and woe
Here I go, singing low
Bye bye, blackbird

Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet and so is he
Bye, bye, blackbird

No one here can love and understand me
Oh, what hard-luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed, light the light, I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird, bye bye") }}
