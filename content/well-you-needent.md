{{ lyrics("You're talkin' so sweet well you needn't
You say you won't cheat well you needn't
You're tappin' your feet well you needn't
It's over now, it's over now

You're dressin' with class well you needn't
You're holdin' your sass well you needn't
You think you're a gas well you needn't
It's over now, it's over now

It's over now, it's over now
You've had your fun, so take a bow
You oughta know, you lost the glow, the beat is slow, the shadows grow
The lights are low, it's time to go, let's close the show down

Oh You're taking off weight well you needn't
You're looking just great well you needn't
You're settin' the bait well you needn't
It's over now, it's over now") }}
