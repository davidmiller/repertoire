{{ lyrics("How I miss all our stolen little moments
The many times I'm not with you
They are such precious stolen moments
That are meant only for us two
Whenever you're gone and I know you're not here
It's so hard to remember when you disappear
With your face always there, right in front of me dear
But you belong to her, but you belong to her

Why do we have to have stolen moments
Why can't I always have you near
Holding you in my arms forever
When I never have anything
Whenever you're gone and I know you're not here
It's so hard to remember when you disappear
With your face always there, right in front of me dear
But you belong to her

I have heard when you have stolen moments
It is called an affair
I don't want to have just stolen moments
So be mine and I'll always care
Whenever you're gone
And I know you're not here
It's so hard to remember, when you disappear
with your face always there right in front of me, dear
But you belong to her") }}
