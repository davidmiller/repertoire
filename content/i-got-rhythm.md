{{ lyrics("I got rhythm
I got music,
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more

I've got daisies
In green pastures
I've got my man
Who could ask for anything more

Old man trouble I don't mind him
You won't find him 'round my door

I've got starlight
I've got sweet dreams
I've got my man
Who could ask for anything more") }}
