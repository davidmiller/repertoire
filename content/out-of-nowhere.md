{{ lyrics("You came to me from out of nowhere
You took my heart and found it free

Wonderful dreams, wonderful schemes from nowhere
Made every hour sweet as a flower for me

If you should go back to your nowhere
Leaving me with the memory

I'll always wait for your return out of nowhere
Hoping you'll bring your love to me") }}
