{{ lyrics("I love you come the April breeze
I love you echoes the hills
I love you the golden dawn agrees
As once more she sees daffodils

It's spring again
And birds on the wing again
Start to sing again
The old melody
I love you
That's song of songs
And it all belongs to you and me
It's spring again
And birds on the wing again
Start to sing again
The old melody
I love you
That's the song of songs
And it all belongs to you and me") }}
