{{ lyrics("I know I should pity me
But I don't because, you see
I have loved and I have learned
And as far as I'm concerned

I should care
I should go around weeping
I should care
I should go without sleeping

Strangely enough I sleep well
'Cept for a dream or two
But, then, I count my sheep well
Funny how sheep can tell you to sleep, so

I should care
I should let it upset me
I should care
But it just doesn't get me

Maybe I should find
Someone as lovely as you
But I should care
And I do") }}
