{{ lyrics("I'm gonna love you
Like nobody's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain
And deep as a river
Come rain or come shine

I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don' t ever bet me
Cause I'm gonna be true
If you let me

You're gonna love me
Like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together, unhappy together
And won't it be fine

Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in, or we're out of the money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine") }}
