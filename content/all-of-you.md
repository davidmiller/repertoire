{{ lyrics("I love the looks of you, the lure of you
I'd love to make a tour of you
The eyes, the arms, the mouth of you
The east, west, north and the south of you

I'd love to gain complete control of you
And handle even the heart and soul of you
Love at least a small percent of me do
Yes, I love all of you") }}
