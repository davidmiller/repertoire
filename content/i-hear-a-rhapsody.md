{{ lyrics("And when I hear you call
So softly to me
I don't hear a call at all
I hear a Rhapsody

And when your sparkling eyes
Are smiling at me
Then soft through the starlit skies
I hear a rhapsody

My days are so blue
When you're away
My heart longs for you
So won't you stay

My darling, hold me tight
And whisper to me
Then soft through a starry night
I'll hear a rhapsody") }}
