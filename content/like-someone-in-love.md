{{ lyrics("Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars
Hearing guitars like someone in love

Sometimes the things I do astound me
Mostly whenever you're around me

Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings
Bump into things like someone in love

Each time I look at you
I'm limp as a glove
And feeling like someone in love

Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings
Bump into things like someone in love

Each time I look at you
I'm limp as a glove
And feeling like someone in love
Feeling like someone in love") }}
