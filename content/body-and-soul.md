{{ lyrics("My days have grown so lonely
For you I cry, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longin'
I'm wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd throw away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I can have one more chance to prove, dear

My life a hell you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender
Myself to you body and soul") }}
