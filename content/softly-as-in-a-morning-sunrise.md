{{ lyrics("Softly as in a mornin' sunrise
The light of love comes stealing
Into a newborn day

Flamin' with all the glow of sunrise
A burning kiss is sealing
The vow that all betray

For the passions that thrill love
Lift you high to heaven
Are the passions that kill love
And lead ya down to hell
Same old story ...

Softly as in an evenin' sunset
The light that gave you glory
Will take it all away") }}
