{{ lyrics("They're writing songs of love, but not for me
A lucky star's above, but not for me
With love to lead the way
I found more skies of gray

Than any Russian play could guarantee
I was a fool to fall, and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss
The memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me") }}
