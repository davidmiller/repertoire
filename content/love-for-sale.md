{{ lyrics("Love for sale
Appetising young love for sale
Love that's fresh and still unspoiled
Love that's only slightly soiled
Love for sale

Who will buy?
Who would like to sample my supply?
Who's prepared to pay the price
For a trip to paradise?

If you want the thrill of love
I've been through the mill of love
Old love, new love
Every love but true love

Love for sale
Appetising young love for sale
If you want to buy my wares
Follow me and climb the stairs
Love for sale") }}
