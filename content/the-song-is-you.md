{{ lyrics("I hear music when I look at you;
A beautiful theme of ev'ry
Dream I ever knew
Down deep in my heart I hear it play
I feel it start, then melt away

I hear music when I touch your hand;
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me
Why can't I let it go
Why can't I let you know
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring
The music is sweet
The words are true -
The song is you") }}
