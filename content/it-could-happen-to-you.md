{{ lyrics("Hide your heart from sight,
Lock your dreams at night,
It could happen to you.

Don't count stars,
Or you might stumble.
Someone drops a sigh,
And down you'll tumble.

Keep an eye on spring,
Run when church bells ring.

It could happen to you.
All I did was wonder how your arms would be,
And it happened to me.") }}
