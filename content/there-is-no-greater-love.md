{{ lyrics("There is no greater love than what I feel for you
No greater love
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that you are mine alone...

There is no greater love in all the world
It's true
No greater love than what I feel for you") }}
