{{ lyrics("This moment, this minute
And each second in it
Will leave a glow upon the sky
And as time goes by, it will never die

This will be my shining hour
Calm and happy and bright
And in my dreams, your face will flower
Through the darkness of the night

Like the lights of home before me
Or an angel who's watching o'er me
This will be my shining hour
'Til I'm with you again

Like the lights of home before me
Or an angel watching o'er me
This will be my shining hour
'Til I'm with you again") }}
