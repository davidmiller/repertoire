{{ lyrics("Look at me, I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree;
And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, just holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty, the moment you're near

Can't you see that you're leading me on?
And it's just what I want you to do
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love") }}
