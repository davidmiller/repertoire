{{ lyrics("A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an Oh, beg your pardon
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said May I have the next one?
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words Ever after
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream") }}
