{{ lyrics("A foggy day in London Town
Had me low and had me down
I viewed the morning with such alarm
British Museum had lost its charm

How long, I wondered, could this thing last?
But the age of miracles hadn't passed
For, suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London Town

The sun was shining everywhere
A foggy day in London Town
Had me low and had me down
I viewed the morning with such alarm

The old British Museum had lost its charm
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?
But the age of miracles hadn't passed
For, suddenly, I saw you there
And in a foggy London Town
The sun was shining everywhere") }}
