{{ lyrics("Beautiful love, you're all a mystery
Beautiful love, what have you done to me?
I was contented 'till you came along
Thrilling, my soul with your song

Beautiful love, you're all a mystery
Beautiful love, what have you done to me?
I was contented 'till you came along
Will my dreams come true") }}
