{{ lyrics("Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
Each one she passes goes ah

When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes goes ooh

But I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall, and tan, and young, and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile but she doesn't see") }}
