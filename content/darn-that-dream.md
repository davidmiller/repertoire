{{ lyrics("Darn that dream
I dream each night
You say you love me and hold me tight
But when I awake and you're out of sight
Oh, darn that dream

Darn your lips and darn your eyes
They lift me high above the moonlit sky
Then I tumble out of paradise
Oh, darn that dream

Darn that one track mind of mine
It can't understand that you don't care
Just to change the mood I'm in
I'd welcome a nice old nightmare

Darn that dream
And bless it too
Without that dream I never have you
But it haunts me and it won't come true

Oh, darn that dream ") }}
