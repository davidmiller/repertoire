{{ lyrics("Have you met Miss Jones
someone said as we shook hands
She was just Miss Jones to me

Then I said Miss Jones
you're a girl who understand
I'm a boy who must be free.

And all at once I lost my breath
and all at once was scared to death
and all at once I hold the earth and sky!

Now I met Miss Jones
and well keep on meeting till we die
Miss Jones and I") }}
