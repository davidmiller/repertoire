{{ lyrics("Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you
Just one look at you my heart grew tipsy in me
You and you alone bring out the gypsy in me

I love all the many charms about you
Above all I want my arms about
Don't be a naughty baby
Come to papa come to papa do
My sweet embraceable you") }}
