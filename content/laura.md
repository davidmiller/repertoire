{{ lyrics("Laura is the face in the misty lights
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall

And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream

And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream") }}
