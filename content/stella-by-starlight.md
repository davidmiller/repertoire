{{ lyrics("The song a robin sings,
Through years of endless springs,
The murmur of a brook at evening tides.
That ripples through a nook where two lovers hide.

That great symphonic theme,
That's Stella by starlight,
And not a dream,
My heart and I agree,
She's everything on this earth to me.

That great symphonic theme,
That's Stella by starlight,
And not a dream,
My heart and I agree,
She's everything on this earth to me.") }}
