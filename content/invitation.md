{{ lyrics("You and your smile
Hold a strange invitation
Somehow it seems
We've shared our dreams
But where?

Time after time
In a room full of strangers
Out of the blue
Suddenly you are there

Wherever I go
You're the glow of temptation
Glancing my way
In the gray of the dawn

And always your eyes
Smile that strange invitation
When you are gone
Where oh, where have you gone?

How long must I stay
In a world of illusion?
Be where you are
So near yet so far apart") }}
