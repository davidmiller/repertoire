{{ lyrics("Grab your coat and get your hat, leave your worry at the doorstep
Just direct your feet to the sunny side of the street

Can't you hear that pitter pat and that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet on the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade with those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid 'cause this rover, crossed over

If I never had a cent I'll be as rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet on the sunny side of the street") }}
