{{ lyrics("I went down to St. James Infirmary
To see my baby there
She was lyin' on a long white table
So sweet, so cool, so fair

Went up to see the doctor
She's very low, he said
Went back to see my baby
Good God! She's lying there dead

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search the wide world over
And never find a better man than me

Oh, when I die, please bury me
In my ten dollar Stetson hat
Put a twenty-dollar gold piece on my watch chain
So my friends'll know I died standin' pat") }}
