{{ lyrics("Quiet nights of quiet stars
Quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us

Quiet thoughts and dreams
Quiet walks by quiet streams
And a window on the
Mountains and the sea, how lovely

This is where I want to be
Here with you so close to me
Until the final flicker of life's ember

I, who was lost and lonely
Believing life was only a bitter, tragic joke
Have found with you
The meaning of existence, oh, my love ") }}
