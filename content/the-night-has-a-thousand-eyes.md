{{ lyrics("Don't whisper things to me you don't mean
For words deep down inside can be seen by the night
The night has a thousand eyes
And it knows the truth apart from one that lies

The romance may have cooled in the past
My love for you will be everlasting and bright
As bright as a starlit sky
And the wondrous night that has a thousand eyes

I've lived my life walking through a dream
For I knew that I would find this moment supreme
A night of bliss and tender sighs
And the smiling down of a thousand eyes

A night of bliss and tender sighs
And the smiling down of a thousand eyes
The night has a thousand eyes") }}
