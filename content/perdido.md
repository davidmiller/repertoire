{{ lyrics("Perdido, I look for my heart it's perdido
I lost it way down in Torido
While chancing a dance fiesta

Bolero, he glanced as I danced the Bolero
He said taking off his sombrero:
'Let's meet for a sweet fietsa'

High was the sun when we first came close
Low was the moon when we said adios

Perdido, since then has my heart been perdido
I know I must go to Torido,
that yearning to lose perdido") }}
