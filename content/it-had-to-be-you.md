{{ lyrics("Why do I do just as you say
Why must I just give you your way
Why do I sigh
Why don't I try to forget

It must have been that something lovers call fate
Kept me saying I had to wait
I saw them all
Just couldn't fall 'til we met

It had to be you
It had to be you
I wandered around
And finally found
The somebody who
Could make me be true

And could make me be blue
And even be glad
Just to be sad
Thinking of you") }}
