{{ lyrics("In a mellow tone
Feeling fancy free
And I'm not alone
I've got company

Everything's ok
The live long day
With this mellow song
I can't go wrong

In a mellow tone
That's the way to live
If you mope and groan
Something's gotta give

Just go your way
And laugh and play
There's joy unknown
In a mellow tone") }}
