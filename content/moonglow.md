{{ lyrics("It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you

I still hear you sayin', Dear one, hold me fast
And I keep on prayin', Oh Lord, please let this last

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you") }}
