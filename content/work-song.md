{{ lyrics("Breaking rocks out here on the chain gang
Breaking rocks and serving my time
Breaking rocks out here on the chain gang
Because they done convicted me of crime
Hold it steady right there while I hit it
Well I reckon that ought to get it
Been Working and working
But I still got so terribly far to go

I commited crime Lord I needed
Crime of being hungry and poor
I left the grocery store man bleeding (breathing?)
When they caught me robbing his store
Hold it steady right there while I hit it
Well I reckon that ought to get it
Been Working and working
But I still got so terribly far to go") }}
