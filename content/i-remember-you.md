{{ lyrics("I remember You
You're the one
Who made my dreams
Come true
A few kisses ago

I remember you
You're the one
Who said
I love you too
Didn't you know?

I remember too
A distant bell
And stars that fell
Like rain
Out of the blue

When my life is through
And the angels ask me
To recall
The thrill of them all

Then I shall tell them
I remember you") }}
