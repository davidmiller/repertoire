{{ lyrics("I've been around the world in a plane
Settled revolutions in Spain
The North Pole I have charted
But can't get started with you

Around the golf course I'm under par
Metro-Goldwyn wants me to star
I've got a house and a show place
But can't get no place with you

You're so supreme
The lyrics I write of you
Dream, dream, day and night of you
Scheme just for the sight of you
Baby but what good does it do?

I've been consulted by Franklin D.
Robert Taylor has had me to tea
But now I'm broken-hearted
Can't get started with you") }}
