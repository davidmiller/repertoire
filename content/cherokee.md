{{ lyrics("Brave Indian warrior
Since first I met you
I can't forget you
Cherokee sweetheart!

Child of the prairie
Your love keeps calling
My heart enthralling
You Cherokee!

In the Summertime
Of lover time gone by
From my memory
So tenderly inside!

My brave Indian warrior
Obne day I'll hold you
In my arms hold you
My Cherokee!") }}
