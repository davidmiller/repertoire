{{ lyrics("Why do I just wither and forget all resistance
when you and your magic pass by
my heart's in a dither dear
when you're at a distance
but when you are near, oh my...

Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no
Its just the nearness of you

It isn't your sweet conversation
That brings this sensation, oh no
Its just the nearness of you

When you're in my arms
and I feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams come true

I need no soft lights to enchant me
If you'll only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night
the nearness of you.") }}
